Hi there, I'm Alon! 👋
I'm a Practical Software Engineer and a recent graduate (with distinction) from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. I'm passionate about building products that solve real-world problems and I love diving deep into new technologies from end to end.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Cloud and DevOps technologies.

🔭 I’m looking for my first full-time role as a Software / DevOps Engineer.

💬 Ask me about Flutter, Firebase, or my final project, TeamBuzz!

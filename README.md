### Hi there, I'm Alon! 👋

I'm a Practical Software Engineer and a recent graduate (with distinction) from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. I'm passionate about building products that solve real-world problems and I love diving deep into new technologies from end to end.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Cloud and DevOps technologies.
- 🔭 I’m looking for my first full-time role as a Software / DevOps Engineer.
- 💬 Ask me about Flutter, Firebase, or my final project, TeamBuzz!
